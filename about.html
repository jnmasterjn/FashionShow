            <h1>About the Fashion Show</h1>
            <p>Our fashion show is a celebration of sustainability, creativity, and community. We collect old, unwanted shirts from generous donors and transform them into stunning, repurposed fashion pieces. These revitalized garments take center stage in our show, highlighting the beauty of upcycling and the potential for fashion to make a positive impact on the environment.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We aim to raise awareness about sustainable fashion by turning waste into wearable art. Our mission is to show that fashion can be both stylish and eco-friendly, reducing textile waste and inspiring others to rethink their clothing choices. Through this show, we hope to promote a culture of reuse and recycling while supporting a more sustainable future for fashion. </p>
            
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Upcycle Fashion Show was founded in 2024 by a group of passionate 11th graders who wanted to make a difference in the world of fashion.</p>
